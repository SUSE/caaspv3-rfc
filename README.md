# Kubic Project Request for Comments

This repository contains Request for Comments documents used as part of the Kubic
development process. Major features or rework should be documented here prior to
any working beginning on them.

This serves to provide a history of decision making, and a clearer more open
process for moving the project forward.

## Process notes


* A card in the backlog requesting the creation of the RFC is added to the sprint. 

* Anyone in the team can take over the card and write the RFC.
The RFC template is available [here](https://github.com/kubic-project/rfc/blob/master/rfc-template.md)

* Once the RFC is submitted as a PR, an email should be sent to caasp-devel@suse.de letting everyone know the RFC is ready to be reviewed.
At this point, everyone on the team is expected to read the RFC. 
Review comments should be posted on GitHub (and if necessary on the mailing list)

* Any comments/questions/issues/etc should be given within 7 days. At the end of the 7 days, if no major disagreements are remaining, the PR can be merged. 

* During the planning meeting, merged RFCs will be turned into epics and pulled into the sprint, squads will formed, and cards created within the backlog to implement the RFC.

**Only at this point in time actual implementation will start, not before.**
